# rusvid_scripting_test

Test repo for [rusvid](https://github.com/LetsMelon/rusvid) to experiment with different 'scripting' solutions for rust. Goal is that a user of `rusvid` is able to create a custom `Effect` (e.g.: (Grayscale)[https://github.com/LetsMelon/rusvid/blob/main/crates/effect/src/library/grayscale.rs]) without touching the rust code.

Solutions:
- (rhai)[https://github.com/rhaiscript/rhai]: main branch
